## Buying Prices

### Origin of data

The data is obtained from Zillow Enterprise.

[Home Values](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)

From their enterprise pages:

```Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. The raw version of that mid-tier ZHVI time series is also available.```

```Zillow publishes top-tier ZHVI ($, typical value for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region) and bottom-tier ZHVI ($, typical value for homes that fall within the 5th to 35th percentile range for a given region).```

```Zillow also publishes ZHVI for all single-family residences ($, typical value for all single-family homes in a given region), for condo/coops ($), for all homes with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ bedrooms ($), and the ZHVI per square foot ($, typical value of all homes per square foot calculated by taking the estimated home value for each home in a given region and dividing it by the home’s square footage). Check out this overview of ZHVI and a deep-dive into its methodology.```

```Here’s a handy ZHVI User Guide for information about properly citing and making calculations with this metric.```
